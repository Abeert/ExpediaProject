I used Java for implementing the application. Java is the language I enjoy working with. It is a strong language with variant libraries that support web applications.
I used RestFul API to implement services, and used JSON libraries to allow parsing data efficiently and within the fewest lines possible. 
I also used Javascript to manage page fields, submit requests, and display output.
This project did add to my experience since I have very little experience working with Restful API, JSON, JS, and CSS. Most of my experience is at other frameworks, and is more at the backend level.
